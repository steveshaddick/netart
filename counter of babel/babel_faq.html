        <strong>1 - Isn't counting to infininty impossible?</strong></p>
      <p class="style4">There are many definitions of what exactly infinity is (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity" target="_blank">wikipedia</a>, or <a href="http://www.c-parr.freeserve.co.uk/hcp/infinity.htm" target="_blank">here</a>). One common conceptualization is to describe it as the result of continuously adding 1. Let's call this 'popular infinity' to make it distinct from higher-order infinities used in disciplines like set theory (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Cantor" target="_blank">Georg Cantor</a>). If popular infintiy is reached by constantly adding up 1+1+1+1... , so long as the counter is able to count, the only possible conclusion is to reach infinity. It would of course be impossible for a human to perform these operations by hand since any physical resource used (paper, pencil, etc) becomes quicly exhausted. However, the resources used by a computer are much less physically demanding.</p>

      <p class="style4"><strong>2 - But won't the resources used by the computer (hard drive, processing power) eventually run out once the number gets too large?</strong></p>
      <p class="style4">The system resources used by the Counter of Babel are so small and increase so fractionally compared to how computers' system resources tend to upgrade exponentially that it is safe to assume any computer of the future will be able to handle the current count.</p>
      <p class="style4">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="style4"><strong><a name="3" id="3"></a></strong></p>
      <p class="style4"><strong>3 - I'm a pretentious math enthusiast who can disprove everything you are saying. What do you think of that?</strong></p>
      <p class="style4">Go ahead and disprove me a river. Any proof existing solely on paper is only ever a proof of rhetoric. Introducing a tanigble element is the ultimate method for testing a proven theory. For example, I used 51 characters in this sentence. Devise a method for disproving the previous statement without physically counting anything.</p>

      <p class="style4"><strong><a name="4" id="4"></a></strong></p>
      <p class="style4"><strong>4 - What if humans stop using computers in the future?</strong></p>
      <p class="style4">There are infinitely many possibilities for the future. The Counter of Babel is a simple program and uses basic commands that could be upgraded or transferred to whatever technology replaces current forms. It's impossible to predict the future, all that can be done is to ensure that at any given present moment the counter is able to run.</p>

      <p class="style4"><strong><a name="5" id="5"></a></strong></p>
      <p class="style4"><strong>5 - Assuming all other things being equal, for how long can the Counter of Babel count?</strong></p>
      <p class="style4">The Counter of Babel stores numbers into exponential units of billions. So, the first unit maxes out at 1 billion. The second unit maxes out at 1 billion billion. The third at 1 billion billion billion and so forth. If one computer was running the counter, it would take 6 years to max out the first unit and 6 billion years to max out the second. If everyone in the world were running the program, it would only take about a year to max out the first two units, but another billion years to max out the third. Since the storage capacity allows for literally millions of units, it's conceivable to say that the Sun is scheduled to burn out before the Counter of Babel stops counting.</p>

      <p class="style4"><strong><a name="6" id="6"></a></strong></p>
      <p class="style4"><strong>6 - But if the Sun burns out, wouldn't that mean the Counter would eventually stop counting and thus never reach infinity?</strong></p>
      <p class="style4">True, but it will have made it closer to infinity more accurately than any other counter before it. And if that is the highest number ever reached by  continously adding 1 to itself, who is to say such a number isn't infinity? </p>

      <p class="style4"><strong><a name="7" id="7"></a></strong></p>
      <p class="style4"><strong>7 - What's the difference between the Counter of Babel and randomly typing in numbers in a text editor to make a number thousands of digits long?</strong></p>
      <p class="style4">The difference lies in that the Counter has actually counted to the number it displays. Typing in a string of numbers does form an incredibly large number, but not having reached it one step at a time, the number is meaningless. </p>
      <p class="style4">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="style4"><strong><a name="8" id="8"></a></strong></p>
      <p class="style4"><strong>8 - Why have you decided to count to infinity?</strong></p>
      <p class="style4">Because it's there.  </p>
      <p class="style4">&nbsp;</p>
      <p class="style4"><strong><a name="9" id="9"></a></strong></p>
      <p class="style4"><strong>9 - How does the Counter of Babel really work?</strong></p>
      <p class="style4">Whenever someone is on the site, the Counter of Babel is counting. Every so often, it updates the database. If multiple users are on the site at the same time, the number count will increase at a greater rate. In order to bypass resource limitations on numeric data types in computers, the Counter of Babel uses a method of parsing and storing numbers as groups of digits. This allows it to sequentially calculate  extremely large numbers. If you are particularily interested in the code behind the counter, see the <a href="CounterOfBabel.txt" target="_blank">source code</a>. I am completely open to any suggestions that could make the code stronger. </p>

      <p class="style4"><strong>10 - I was watching the counter closely -  why did it appear to skip over certain numbers? </strong></p>
      <p class="style4">If mulitple people are on the site at the same time, you'll notice a leap-frog effect where the counter has taken into account other peoples' counts. This effectively means the more people on the site at the same time will allow the counter to count faster. </p>

      <p class="style4"><strong>11 - Why does my browser keep refreshing? </strong></p>
      <p class="style4">The browser keeps refreshing because it is updating the database </p>
